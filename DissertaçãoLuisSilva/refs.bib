The diagnosis relies on clinical findings, supported by adequate testing. There is no absolute method to diagnose Parkinson’s disease in vivo, except for genetic testing in specific circumstances, whose usefulness is limited to a minority of cases. New diagnostic criteria have been recently proposed with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy, emphasizing findings that might point to other causes of parkinsonism. The available therapeutic options are clinically useful, as they improve the symptoms as well as the quality of life of patients. After the introduction of levodopa, deep brain stimulation emerged as the second therapy with an important symptomatic impact in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.

	abstract = {Objective: Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by a large number of motor and non-motor features that can impact on function to a variable degree. This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.Methods: A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included {\textquotedblleft}Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}diagnosis{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}signs and symptoms{\textquotedblright}.Results: Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.Conclusions: A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.},

This review addresses the concept that sex differences in PD are determined, largely, by biological sex differences in the NSDA system which, in turn, arise from hormonal, genetic and environmental influences. Current therapies for PD rely on dopamine replacement strategies to treat symptoms, and there is an urgent, unmet need for disease modifying agents. As a significant degree of neuroprotection against the early stages of clinical or experimental PD is seen, respectively, in human and rodent females compared with males, a better understanding of brain sex dimorphisms in the intact and injured NSDA system will shed light on mechanisms which have the potential to delay, or even halt, the progression of PD. Available evidence suggests that sex-specific, hormone-based therapeutic agents hold particular promise for developing treatments with optimal efficacy in men and women.}

ABSTRACT = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a nervous system disorder first described as a neurological condition in 1817. It is one of the more prevalent diseases in the elderly, and Alzheimer’s is the second most common neurodegenerative illness. It impacts the patient’s movement. Symptoms start gradually with tremors, stiffness in movement, and speech and voice disorders. Researches proved that 89% of patients with Parkinson’s has speech disorder including uncertain articulation, hoarse and breathy voice and monotone pitch. The cause behind this voice change is the reduction of dopamine due to damage of neurons in the substantia nigra responsible for dopamine production. In this work, Parkinson’s disease is classified with the help of human voice signals. Six different machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in the classification: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classifier, and Decision Tree (DT) Classifier. This research aims to classify Parkinson’s disease using human voice signals and extract essential features to reduce the complexity of the dataset. Then, human voice signals are analyzed to check the voice intensity and spectrum for PD patients. Then, machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the PD patients based on the extracted features. The results show that SGD-Classifier has 91% accuracy, XGB-Classifier has 95% accuracy, Logistic Regression has 91% accuracy, Random Forest shows 97% accuracy, KNN shows 95% accuracy, and Decision Tree has 95% accuracy. Hence, Random Forest has the highest accuracy. The disease can be studied more by looking for more characteristics of PD patients to enhance its proper use in the medical field.},

ABSTRACT = {Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) currently affects approximately 10 million people worldwide. The detection of PD positive subjects is vital in terms of disease prognostics, diagnostics, management and treatment. Different types of early symptoms, such as speech impairment and changes in writing, are associated with Parkinson disease. To classify potential patients of PD, many researchers used machine learning algorithms in various datasets related to this disease. In our research, we study the dataset of the PD vocal impairment feature, which is an imbalanced dataset. We propose comparative performance evaluation using various decision tree ensemble methods, with or without oversampling techniques. In addition, we compare the performance of classifiers with different sizes of ensembles and various ratios of the minority class and the majority class with oversampling and undersampling. Finally, we combine feature selection with best-performing ensemble classifiers. The result shows that AdaBoost, random forest, and decision tree developed for the RUSBoost imbalanced dataset perform well in performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the geometric mean. Further, feature selection methods, namely lasso and information gain, were used to screen the 10 best features using the best ensemble classifiers. AdaBoost with information gain feature selection method is the best performing ensemble method with an F1-score of 0.903.},

abstract = {Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness with both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established safe neurosurgical symptomatic therapy for eligible patients with advanced disease in whom medical treatment fails to provide adequate symptom control and good quality of life, or in whom dopaminergic medications induce severe side effects such as dyskinesias. DBS can be tailored to the patient's symptoms and targeted to various nodes along the basal ganglia–thalamus circuitry, which mediates the various symptoms of the illness; DBS in the thalamus is most efficient for tremors, and DBS in the pallidum most efficient for rigidity and dyskinesias, whereas DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can treat both tremors, akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesias, and allows for decrease in doses of medications even in patients with advanced stages of the disease, which makes it the preferred target for DBS. However, DBS in the STN assumes that the patient is not too old, with no cognitive decline or relevant depression, and does not exhibit severe and medically resistant axial symptoms such as balance and gait disturbances, and falls. Dysarthria is the most common side effect of DBS, regardless of the brain target. DBS has a long-lasting effect on appendicular symptoms, but with progression of disease, nondopaminergic axial features become less responsive to DBS. DBS for PD is highly specialised; to enable adequate selection and follow-up of patients, DBS requires dedicated multidisciplinary teams of movement disorder neurologists, functional neurosurgeons, specialised DBS nurses and neuropsychologists.},

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Portuguese community-dwelling population; that is, elderly people living in the community on their own, aged ≥50 years and resident in mainland Portugal, in two phases: (i) a questionnaire was applied to screen potential cases of PD; and (ii) screened cases were evaluated by an expert in PD to confirm diagnosis. Results The adjusted prevalence of PD for the Portuguese community-dwelling population aged ≥50 years was 0.24\%. The estimated total number of cases of PD for the Portuguese population is 180/100 000 inhabitants. Conclusions The results of this study show that a geographical region with a high frequency of a causal mutation for PD does not automatically imply a high prevalence of patients with PD.},

abstract = {An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease by specialists involves many neurological, psychological and physical examinations. The specialists investigate a number of symptoms and signs when examining the nervous system conditions of a person. The diagnosis involves reviewing the medical history and genetic factor of the person. The recent diagnosis methodology to Parkinson’s disease relies on voice disorders analysis. This methodology entails extracting feature sets of a recorded person’s voice then utilizing a machine learning technique to identify the healthy and Parkinson’s cases from the voice. This paper attempts to improve the diagnoses of Parkinson’s disease by testing multiple feature evaluation and classification machine learning methods based on the voice disorders analysis. The aim of this paper is to find the optimal solution to the problem by (i) proposing a new Multiple Feature Evaluation Approach (MFEA) of a multi-agent system (ii) implementing five independent classification schemas which are Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine on the Parkinson’s diagnosis before and after applying the MFEA, and (iii) evaluating the diagnosis accuracy of the results. The methodology of the tests encompasses 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the learning of methods and track variation in their performance. The test results show that the MFEA of the multi-agent system finds the best set of features and improves the performance of the classifiers. The average rate of improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of the classifiers are Decision Tree 10.51%, Naïve Bayes 15.22%, Neural Network 9.19%, Random Forests 12.75%, and Support Vector Machine 9.13%. These results show that the MFEA makes a significant improvement to the classifiers’ diagnosis results.}

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the development of telediagnosis and telemonitoring systems for Parkinson’s disease (PD) based on measuring the motor system disorders caused by the disease. As approximately 90% percent of PD patients exhibit some form of vocal disorders in the earlier stages of the disease, the recent PD telediagnosis studies focus on the detection of the vocal impairments from sustained vowel phonations or running speech of the subjects. In these studies, various speech signal processing algorithms have been used to extract clinically useful information for PD assessment, and the calculated features were fed to learning algorithms to construct reliable decision support systems. In this study, we apply, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) to the voice signals of PD patients for feature extraction, which has higher frequency resolution than the classical discrete wavelet transform. We compare the effectiveness of TQWT with the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods used in diagnosis of PD from vocal disorders. For this purpose, we have collected the voice recordings of 252 subjects in the context of this study and extracted multiple feature subsets from the voice recordings. The feature subsets are fed to multiple classifiers and the predictions of the classifiers are combined with ensemble learning approaches. The results show that TQWT performs better or comparable to the state-of-the-art speech signal processing techniques used in PD classification. We also find that Mel-frequency cepstral and the tunable-Q wavelet coefficients, which give the highest accuracies, contain complementary information in PD classification problem resulting in an improved system when combined using a filter feature selection technique.}

abstract = {This paper aims to employ Machine Learning (ML) classifying algorithms to predict whether the patient has Parkinson's Disease (PD) or not. Motor disorders mainly characterize PD, and consequently, a variety of data sets are recorded from the motor system. These data sets consist of either physical behaviors of patients or neuroimaging data captured from their brains. However, the disease mostly begins years before the motor symptoms. Consequently, non-motor symptoms have been studied more in the last decade. Since about 90% of patients experience vocal disorders in the early stages, these symptoms can be more useful for diagnosing the disease. We will review data sets developed for PD diagnosis and some machine learning classification models applied to these data sets. We will offer some models to accurately predict PD according to vocal symptoms characteristics provided in the UCI Machine Learning database, which suffers a low number of samples compared to features and being imbalanced. The results of comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed classic classification models can outperform various Deep learning methods that have been previously used in the literature. The accuracy of 97.22% was obtained by using Logistic Regression and Voting algorithms.}

ABSTRACT = {Background and Objectives: Recently, many studies have focused on the early detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This disease belongs to a group of neurological problems that immediately affect brain cells and influence the movement, hearing, and various cognitive functions. Medical data sets are often not equally distributed in their classes and this gives a bias in the classification of patients. We performed a Hybrid feature selection framework that can deal with imbalanced datasets like PD. Use the SOMTE algorithm to deal with unbalanced datasets. Removing the contradiction from the features in the dataset and decrease the processing time by using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Materials and Methods: PD acoustic datasets and the characteristics of control subjects were used to construct classification models such as Bagging, K-nearest neighbour (KNN), multilayer perceptron, and the support vector machine (SVM). In the prepressing stage, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) with two-feature selection RFE and PCA were used. The PD dataset comprises a large difference between the numbers of the infected and uninfected patients, which causes the classification bias problem. Therefore, SMOTE was used to resolve this problem. Results: For model evaluation, the train–test split technique was used for the experiment. All the models were Grid-search tuned, the evaluation results of the SVM model showed the highest accuracy of 98.2%, and the KNN model exhibited the highest specificity of 99%. Conclusions: the proposed method is compared with the current modern methods of detecting Parkinson’s disease and other methods for medical diseases, it was noted that our developed system could treat data bias and reach a high prediction of PD and this can be beneficial for health organizations to properly prioritize assets.},

   abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neuron-related disorder due to the decrease in dopaminergic neurons present in the midbrain. For the last few decades, speech is an emerging interest in the analysis and detection of PD. In this study, a predictive machine learning framework based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) features selection and a stacked ensemble approach is presented to investigate the voice tremor of people suffering from PD. The proposed framework consists of two stages: In the first stage the optimized features are obtained using XGBoost features selection, and in the second stage a PD detection system is developed using stacked ensemble classifiers. Leave one subject out (LOSO) cross-validation shows that the proposed framework gives average accuracy of up to 95.07% compared to results obtained with individual classifiers. Additionally, it was also concluded that reduced features had given the highest classification accuracy compared to the raw features set which saves training time and enhances the prediction accuracy.},

   abstract = {The incidence of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is higher in males than in females. This disease can be diagnosed based on gender through the automatic diagnostic system without visiting a specialist physician. For this purpose, the Simple Logistic hybrid system based on the greedy stepwise search algorithm (SLGS) is presented as a novel approach that involves feature analysis to diagnose PD by gender. Six feature groups were extracted from data of 252 subjects and were used to perform this analysis. When the SLGS hybrid system analysis begins, the effective features are first determined by the greedy stepwise search algorithm and diagnosis of PD was made according to the features that were determined using the Simple Logistic classifier. The performance results that were obtained from this system by gender were evaluated using many statistical metrics. The accuracy ratios were 88.71% and 87.15%, with the minimum number of features for males and females, respectively. Additionally, ROC and PRC area values for both genders approached the 0.9 band, showing that the class separation of patients and healthy individuals was nearly perfect. The performance results and perspective of this study were compared with the single published study that used the same data, and the SLGS hybrid system showed higher performance rates than the other study. In addition, the number of the subjects was higher in this study than in other studies and the SLGS system has not been used before in the literature in this field.},

A combination of minimum average maximum (MAMa) tree and singular value decomposition (SVD) are used to extract the salient features from the voice signals. A novel feature signal is constructed from 3 levels of MAMa tree in the preprocessing phase. The SVD operator is applied to the constructed signal for feature extraction. Then 50 most distinctive features are selected using relief feature selection technique. Finally, k nearest neighborhood (KNN) with 10-fold cross validation is used for the classification. We have achieved the highest classification accuracy rate of 92.46% using vowels with KNN classifier. The dataset used consists of 3 vowels for each person. To obtain individual results, post processing step is performed and best result of 96.83% is obtained with KNN classifier. The proposed method is ready to be tested with huge database and can aid the neurologists in the diagnosis of PD using vowels.},

Detection and early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease are essential in terms of disease progression and treatment process. Parkinson's disease dataset used in this study was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. The proposed hybrid machine learning method consists of two stages: i) data pre-processing (over-sampling), ii) classification. The Parkinson's disease dataset (PD dataset) is a two-class dataset. While 192 data belong to normal (healthy) individuals, 564 data belong to the diseased class (PD). The data set has an imbalanced class distribution. To transform this imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) method is used. Then, after converting to a balanced class distribution, Random Forests classification method was used for classification of Parkinson's disease dataset. The PD dataset consists of 753 attributes. Only the random forests classification were classified as 87.037% in the classification of PD dataset, while the proposed hybrid method (the combination of SMOTE and random forests) achieved 94.89% classification success. Obtained results showed that promising resultshad been achieved in discrimination of the PD dataset with this hybrid method.},

   abstract = {We propose a two-step classification framework to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using speech samples. At the first stage, multiple one-way ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) is used on independent subsets of vocal features to extract the best set of features from each speech processing algorithm. These extracted feature subsets are then merged with other baseline vocal features (shimmer, jitter, pitch, harmonicity, vocal fold, and fundamental frequency parameters) to form the training feature set. In the second step, this combined training set is used to train an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification model, which is a decision tree based algorithm. The overall model performance was scored and evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under Curve (ROC AUC), F-Measure, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and accuracy. It was then compared with benchmarked statistical classifiers and other studies that use different combinations of features from this PD dataset. We apply one-way ANOVA on different speech feature sets to extract the best features without losing useful vocal information. Our classification performance outperforms state-of-the-art PD classification models that use generic feature selection methods or use only one or more of the vocal feature subsets.},

@article{silviadeldin,
   abstract = {Background: Gait is emerging as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool, and as a surrogate marker of disease progression for Parkinson's disease (PD). Accelerometer-based body worn monitors (BWMs) facilitate the measurement of gait in clinical environments. Moreover they have the potential to provide a more accurate reflection of gait in the home during habitual behaviours. Emerging research suggests that measurement of gait using BWMs is feasible but this has not been investigated in depth. The aims of this study were to explore (i) the impact of environment and (ii) ambulatory bout (AB) length on gait characteristics for discriminating between people with PD and age-matched controls. Methods: Fourteen clinically relevant gait characteristics organised in five domains (pace, variability, rhythm, asymmetry, postural control) were quantified using laboratory based and free-living data collected over 7 days using a BWM placed on the lower back in 47 PD participants and 50 controls. Results: Free-living data showed that both groups walked with decreased pace and increased variability, rhythm and asymmetry compared to walking in the laboratory setting. Four of the 14 gait characteristics measured in free-living conditions were significantly different between controls and people with PD compared to two measured in the laboratory. Between group differences depended on bout length and were more apparent during longer ABs. ABs ≤ 10s did not discriminate between groups. Medium to long ABs highlighted between-group significant differences for pace, rhythm and asymmetry. Longer ABs should therefore be taken into account when evaluating gait characteristics in free-living conditions. Conclusion: This study provides encouraging results to support the use of a single BWM for free-living gait evaluation in people with PD with potential for research and clinical application.},

However, the value of this essay was not fully recognized during Parkinson's lifetime, which spanned the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars. James Parkinson was one of the most singular figures of his time and place. He was successively or concomitantly a virulent political activist, a popular medical writer, a scholarly medical contributor, a highly appreciated parish doctor, a prominent amateur chemist, a devoted madhouse doctor, and a renowned paleontologist. It is that branch of geology that brought Parkinson fame during his lifetime. He was an insatiable collector of fossils, minerals, and shells that came to form the core of the museum that he set out at his home in Shoreditch, England. These specimens are beautifully illustrated in his Organic Remains of a Former World (1804-1811), a three-volume treatise that rapidly became a standard paleontology textbook. Parkinson was a founding member of the Geological Society of London, and in recognition of his contribution to the nascent field of paleontology his name was given to many fossils, particularly ammonites (e.g. Nautilus parkinsoni). Hence, we owe much to Mr. Parkinson, the Paleontologist, as he used to be referred to after his death, for such a vast and multifaceted contribution to natural science and medicine.},
